1. The procedure p is applied 5 times when (sine 12.15) is evaluated.
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))

2. The number of steps and space used by this process when (sine a) is evaluated is
(ceiling (/ (log (/ a 0.1))
            (log 3))).
In other words we have O(log(x)) order of growth.
